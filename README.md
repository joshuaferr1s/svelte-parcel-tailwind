# Svelte, Parcel, Tailwind Template

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps, [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). It lives at https://github.com/joshuaferr1s/svelte-parcel-tailwind.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit joshuaferr1s/svelte-parcel-tailwind svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/):

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
